The files with the '.p' suffix include Pop-11 code and comments. They
should be treated as plain text files. If your browser cannot read them
that may be because it associated '.p' with another type of file. You
may have to use the 'Open with' option in your web browser (usually via
right click, depending on the browser.)

All of these examples can be run in the Pop-11 system that is part of Poplog,
available for use in a virtual linux that runs on windows, macs, etc.

<br/>
An introduction (for absolute beginners) ideas of grammar, grammatical structures,
lexicon, lexical types, grammar-based random generation of sentences, parsing of
sentences.

<br/>
Examples of things that can be done by learners after being introduced to the
grammar formalism and the library designed for using the grammars to generate or
parse sentences.

Lightly commented, Pop-11 source code for the LIB GRAMMAR package that makes all the
above work. It depends on use of the Pop-11 matcher for list structures. [ADD LINK]

<br/>
    A modified version of Pop-11 LIB GRAMMAR to support use of an ill-formed
    substring table to speed up parsing (with spectacular results).
<br/>
    This, like the original library, finds only one parse, even if the input string
    is ambiguous according to the grammar.
<br/>
    To find where this differs from the original library look for occurrences of
    the global variable <tt>no_parse_found</tt> and calls of the procedure
    <tt>setup_noparses();</tt>
<p>

<br/>
    A grammar for an artificial subset of English relevant to a
    conversational robot.
    <br/>
    This shows how, using Pop-11's formalism for recursive context-free grammars, it
is possible to define a fairly complex grammar for assertions, questions and
commands, for the domain of a robot with the ability to perceive and
manipulate objects on a table.
    <br/>
    (As in the CoSy and CogX robot projects at Birmingham.)
<p>
Using the standard Pop-11 grammar library, parsing sentences of the sorts generated
by this grammar can be very slow.
<p>
Using <b>newgrammar.p,</b> with the ill-formed substring memory, speeds
that up enormously. (The memory is cleared and rebuilt for each
sentence. The program could be changed to create an enduring memory of
things not to try.)
<p>
This grammar was hand-coded, using an idea suggested long ago by Gerald Gazdar,
namely compiling semantic categories into syntactic categories. In a more ambitious
project it might be possible to make a system that can learn such a grammar by being
exposed to a very large corpus of examples.

<br/>
    A lexicon for use with the above grammar, i.e. words to be used in statements,
commands, and questions referring to the robot and its environment and actions.
<br/>
This package has no understanding of inflections: different forms for the same word,
depending on context of use. All words are treated as  unanalysed wholes, except for
the use of apostrophes.

<br/>
    Example code for compiling and testing the grammar and lexicon,
    using the tools in newgrammar.p
    <p>
    This includes some examples that invoke the linux 'espeak' program to say the
    generated sentences out loud.

<br/>
One test sentence parsed, to show the sort of parse tree produced. The sentence is

<pre>
[move the big red box on the tray onto the top of the block on the left side of Jeremy"s triangular horse]

</small>
The parse tree is too big to be displayed easily, though it can be displayed in an
xterm-compatible window, or using the poplog XVed editor.
<p>
A screen-shot of the tree displayed in an xterm window with a small font is below,
<br/>
automatically generated by the Pop-11 'showtree' library package.
