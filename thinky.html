<h3><b>
Introduction
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
The idea of "Thinky" programming is introduced on <a href="examples.html#tasks">this</a>
web
page, which also introduces several other types of programming,
including numbery, bumpy, gadgety,
arty, and exploratory programming. (The
categories are not all mutually exclusive.)
<p>
The key features of "thinky" programming includes getting a computer to
perform some cognitive task that is similar to or inspired by things
humans or other animals can do, such as seeing, planning, playing a
game, or using a natural language to communicate, such as English of
Urdu. This has typically been the domain of research in AI and cognitive
science, and is very difficult to do well enough to match human and
animal competences. But it is possible to introduce some of the ideas
and techniques by focusing on simplified versions of those tasks,
samples of which are provided <a href="examples.html#introductory">here.</a>
</blockquote>
<h3><b>
How to simplify the introductory examples
</b></h3>
<blockquote>
In general developing working "thinky" programming can be very difficult
partly because of the need to provide the program with access to
whatever it is thinking about, e.g. giving it eyes and manipulators, if
it is thinking about physical objects that can be moved around, or
giving it a speaking voice and microphone if it is to engage in
conversational interaction, as well as some sort of body to which people
can relate when interacting with it.
<p>
But AI researchers and teachers have found ways of simplifying the tasks
for beginner students so as to make introductory teaching feasible.
<p>
The simplification can include any or all of the following
<ul>
<li>
Choosing an artificially simple type of behaviour or interaction, e.g. a
simple chat-bot that does not really understand its inputs and outputs,
or a program that interacts with a simple model of some world rather
than the complex external reality that a future robot might have to
interact with.
<li>
Providing library programs that perform some parts of the task or
provide models of the world that the learner's program is to interact
with or reason about. For example, a very simple planning program could
use simulated actions in a simplified world modelled by a teacher's
program; and a simple chatbot exercise might be based on a program whose
architecture is provided by the teacher so that beginner students need
only focus on the rules to be used by the chatbot.
<li>
Instead of requiring the learner to do everything using a general
purpose programming language, and using standard primitive data-types
(e.g. numbers, strings, arrays, records, etc.) the teacher can provide a
problem-specific higher level language allowing the learner to think
about the problem using a language suited to the problem rather than
having to think all the time about the syntax of the base programming
language.
<p>
This requires a programming language that is extendable by defining new
syntactic constructs suited to particular applications. Many languages
allow macros to be defined that extend the language. Some, like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POP11">Pop-11</a>,
allow more powerful extensions to the language, introducing constructs
that would not have been expressible in the original language.
</ul>
A programming language that supports creative teachers in providing
specific learning environments could have a core subset that is general
purpose as well as features that allow the problem specific extensions
to be provided in sharable libraries. This technique has been used for
many years at Sussex university, at Birmingham University and some other
universities, and also some industrial/commercial organisations using
the Poplog system.
<p>
Initially this may be daunting for teachers, but if different teachers
build useful and interesting learning "packages" of this sort, all using
the same base programming language, then they can share their work with
other teachers, and some of the simpler packages, e.g. a library
defining a microworld, can be combined with other packages, e.g. a
library with resources for natural language processing, to allow
students to work on projects that build in the combination, e.g.
designing a program that interacts in (a subset of) natural language,
conversing about the domain.
</blockquote>

<h3><b>
Example microworlds
</b></h3>

<ul>
<li>
Simple chatbots
<li>
A micro-language supporting actions performed in a simple puzzle world,
e.g. the world of a 'river crossing puzzle'
<li>
A combination of the previous two to provide a conversational program
that can talk about the river world, obeying commands and answering
questions
<li>
A variant of the above might be a simulated conversational vending
machine (some students like to produce a "stroppy" variant of such a
machine.
<li>
A microworld in which simple actions can be performed that change
locations and relationships of objects, and in which goals can be
achieved that require the program to plan combinations of actions to
achieve a new state.
<li>
A microworld using an 'agent simulation package' that allows students to
build models of interacting agents, e.g. a sheepdog manipulated by a
mouse and sheep that try to move away when the dog approaches.
<li>
A variant of that in which the dog works out how to steer one sheep,
then later several sheep, into a pen.
<li>
A microworld in which some individuals have to be guarded against
predators or other dangers by a nursemaid.
<li>
Many other simulations using microworlds supported by teacher-created
libraries.
</ul>
<h3><b>
Required resources
</b></h3>
Not all programming languages will be equally good at supporting such
diverse forms of teaching. Some of the requirements for languages and
programming environments to enable creative teachers to inspire their
students were discussed in this paper:
